Hi there! I'm Ava Hajratwala and I'm a computer science major at Barnard College of Columbia University. I'm based in NYC, but I'm originally from just outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

I study computer science because I love how self-directed it is. Each new idea (or fundamentals course), regardless of experience level, is a launching point for seemingly endless new skills and projects. When I was a kid, for example, a casual interest in video games led me down a rabbithole to rudimentary game design in Scratch. And now in college, an introductory lesson in computer networking formed the foundation for me teaching myself frontend web development!

Nowadays, I combine my love for the humanities with my love for computer science. My course load is interdisciplinary by choice â€” I've taken classes in Anthropology, Public Health, History, and Women & Gender Studies alongside highly technical CS classes like Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linear Algebra, and Advanced Programming.

Drawing from my knowledge of systemic inequality and technical skills developing AI agents, I am primarily interested in AI ethics and fairness, especially as the hype around AI systems intensifies. However, I have a wide range of broadly-applicable skills including Python, C, Java, HTML/CSS, and more. Check out [my resume](https://avahajr.github.io/05-24-2023_Resume.pdf)!
